i have created separate json's for layouts and widgets.

run command
node widgets.js - this will automatically filter the json separately for layouts and the widgets using default input.json file and it will create two file layout.filter and widget.filter.

all the wix computed styles available on computed.json file
all the wix raw html available on maindummy.html

please do not run the clean-computed-styles.js file.

if you run the widgets.js file that will create two files one is for layout and another is for widgets you can easily identify.
